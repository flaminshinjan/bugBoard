Implement input validation to prevent buffer overflows ||| Buffer overflow attacks are possible if input validation is not properly implemented, allowing attackers to send oversized inputs that can overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code or crash the system.

Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities ||| Without input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL commands into the database query, leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, or complete database compromise.

Use HTTPS to secure data transmission ||| Using HTTP instead of HTTPS exposes data transmission to interception by attackers, leading to potential data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and loss of sensitive information such as passwords or private keys.
